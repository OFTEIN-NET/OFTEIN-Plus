##  OF@TEIN+ : Open/Federated Playground for Future Networks
### Building and operating Open and Federated Future Internet (SDN/NFV/Cloud-integrated) Testbed

This project is a response to Asi@Connect WP4 (Future Internet) grant support calling.
This document describes the proposed project of “OF@TEIN+: Open/Federated Playgrounds for
Future Networks”, which will leverage and enhance the successfully completed OF@TEIN project. As OF@TEIN project has completed with many success stories, “OF@TEIN+: Open/Federated Playgrounds for Future Networks” is proposed to further enhance, extend and expand OF@TEIN. The
main purpose of OF@TEIN+ is to build and operate an Open and Federated Future Internet (SDN/NFV/Cloud-integrated) Testbed in further promoting SDN-Cloud R&D collaboration among TEIN partners. As a start, we are seeking for grant support for the first 22
months (March 2017 – December 2108).

Primary goals of this project are:

1. Gather and Learn Together: Expanding the OF@TEIN Community and Sharing the Knowledge about
Open and Federated (i.e., shared) SDN/NFV/Cloud-integrated Playground amongst the Members.
2. Build and Upgrade Together: Deployment and Upgrade of Open/Federated Playground with
Distributed SmartX Box Playground Resources and Centralized Data Lake/Analytics Hardware.
3. Operate and Automate Together: Collaborate among Leading Members to enable Automated
DevOps-style Operation of Playground Resources and Platforms.
4. Play and Visualize Together: Collaborate with All Members in Experimenting (i.e., Playing) and
Visualizing “Plays over Playground”.
5. Investigate and Enrich Together: Investigate selected building-block topics on Future Network
technology and attempt to enhance the playground capability/agility by applying the investigation
outcomes.
